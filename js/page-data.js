The heroes can be anything the user wants them to be, an existing hero or just somebody they know. The app utilizes React and Redux for the front end and Node.js for the back end. The battles are determined through a set of rules I came up with and utilizes all the stats the user enters, as well as the super powers the users create. Then it runs one hundred battles on the server side and sends those results back to the client and those results are displayed after each battle. The battles are also recorded and used to update a leaderboard that takes all users and organizes them by number of wins.',
